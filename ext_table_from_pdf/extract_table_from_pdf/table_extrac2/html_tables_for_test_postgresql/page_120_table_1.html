      <td>Translates a textual operator name to its OID. A similar result is obtained by casting the\rstring to type regoper (see Section 8.19); however, this function will return NULL rather\rthan throwing an error if the name is not found or is ambiguous. Also unlike the cast, this\rdoes not accept a numeric OID as input.</td>

A similar\rresult is obtained by casting the string to type regprocedure (see Section 8.19); howev-\rer, this function will return NULL rather than throwing an error if the name is not found.
