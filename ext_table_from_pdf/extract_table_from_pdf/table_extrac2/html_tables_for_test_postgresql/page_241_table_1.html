      <th>NoteThe idx_tup_read and idx_tup_fetch counts can be different even without any use ofbitmap scans, because idx_tup_read counts index entries retrieved from the index whileidx_tup_fetch counts live rows fetched from the table. The latter will be less if any dead ornot-yet-committed rows are fetched using the index, or if any heap fetches are avoided by meansof an index-only scan.</th>
