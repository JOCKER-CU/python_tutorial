      <td>heap_blks_scanned bigint\rNumber of heap blocks scanned. Because the visibility map is used to optimize scans, some\rblocks will be skipped without inspection; skipped blocks are included in this total, so that\rthis number will eventually become equal to heap_blks_total when the vacuum is\rcomplete. This counter only advances when the phase is scanning heap.</td>
