      <th>TipThe easiest way to create the expected files is to create empty files, then do a test run (which willof course report differences). Inspect the actual result files found in the results/ directory (fortests in REGRESS), or output_iso/results/ directory (for tests in ISOLATION), then copythem to expected/ if they match what you expect from the test.</th>
