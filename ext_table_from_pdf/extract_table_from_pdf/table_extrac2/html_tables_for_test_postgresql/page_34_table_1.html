      <th>CautionIf the configuration parameter standard_conforming_strings is off, then PostgreSQL recognizesbackslash escapes in both regular and escape string constants. However, as of PostgreSQL 9.1, thedefault is on, meaning that backslash escapes are recognized only in escape string constants. Thisbehavior is more standards-compliant, but might break applications which rely on the historicalbehavior, where backslash escapes were always recognized. As a workaround, you can set thisparameter to off, but it is better to migrate away from using backslash escapes. If you need to usea backslash escape to represent a special character, write the string constant with an E.Inadditionto standard_conforming_strings,theconfigurationparameterses-cape_string_warning and backslash_quote govern treatment of backslashes in string constants.</th>
