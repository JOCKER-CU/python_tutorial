      <td>typbyval bool\rtypbyval determines whether internal routines pass a value of this type by value or by ref-\rerence. typbyval had better be false if typlen is not 1, 2, or 4 (or 8 on machines where\rDatum is 8 bytes). Variable-length types are always passed by reference. Note that typby-\rval can be false even if the length would allow pass-by-value.</td>

      <td>typrelid oid (references pg_class.oid)\rIf this is a composite type (see typtype), then this column points to the pg_class entry\rthat defines the corresponding table. (For a free-standing composite type, the pg_class en-\rtry doesn't really represent a table, but it is needed anyway for the type's pg_attribute\rentries to link to.)

Types\rthat are “true” array types have typsubscript = array_subscript_handler, but\rother types may have other handler functions to implement specialized subscripting behavior.</td>
