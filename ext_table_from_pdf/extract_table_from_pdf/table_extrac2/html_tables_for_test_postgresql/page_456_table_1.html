If less than zero, the negative of the number of dis-\rtinct values divided by the number of rows. (The negated form is used when ANALYZE be-\rlieves that the number of distinct values is likely to increase as the table grows; the positive\rform is used when the column seems to have a fixed number of possible values.) For exam-\rple, -1 indicates a unique combination of columns in which the number of distinct combina-\rtions is the same as the number of rows.</td>
