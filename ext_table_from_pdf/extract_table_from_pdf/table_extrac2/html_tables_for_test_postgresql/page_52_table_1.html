    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>NoteBecause smallserial, serial and bigserial are implemented using sequences, theremay be "holes" or gaps in the sequence of values which appears in the column, even if no rowsare ever deleted. A value allocated from the sequence is still "used up" even if a row containingthat value is never successfully inserted into the table column. This may happen, for example, ifthe inserting transaction rolls back. See nextval() in Section 9.17 for details.</th>
