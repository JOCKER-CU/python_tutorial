      <th>NotePostgreSQL always initially presumes that a regular expression follows the ARE rules. However,the more limited ERE or BRE rules can be chosen by prepending an embedded option to the REpattern, as described in Section 9.7.3.4. This can be useful for compatibility with applications thatexpect exactly the POSIX 1003.2 rules.</th>
