      <th>NoteThere is an inherent ambiguity between octal character-entry escapes and back references, whichis resolved by the following heuristics, as hinted at above. A leading zero always indicates an octalescape. A single non-zero digit, not followed by another digit, is always taken as a back reference.A multi-digit sequence not starting with a zero is taken as a back reference if it comes after asuitable subexpression (i.e., the number is in the legal range for a back reference), and otherwiseis taken as octal.</th>
